		<details>
			<summary>My Childhood</summary>I moved around a lot while growing up! I went to 15 different schools from kindergarten to twelfth grade. My family has since settled in Lubbock&comma; Texas. It&#39;s very dry and dusty out there&comma; so it always reminds me of a book I had to read in fifth grade called <i>Out of the Dust</i> by Karen Hesse.</details>
